## Published Front End version Beta I Contributions 

### **Primitivo Bambao**  
Primitivo updated the Register and Login forms to fully match the 3rd-party Auth API requirements.  
He ensured that all client-side validation rules aligned with the server-side checks enforced by the external Credentials API.  
He also incorporated the required updates into `src/utils/authOptions.tsx` so the frontend can successfully register users through the external Auth API.

### **Jakita Kaur**  
Jakita built the **Change Password** page that becomes available after login.  
The page includes all backend-required fields, and all client-side validation rules match server expectations.  
This page does **not** connect to the 3rd-party API yet (as required), but the UI and validation logic are fully implemented.

### **Evan Tran**  
Evan created the **Single Movie View** and **Single TV Show View**, displaying complete mock-data information for each item.  
Both views include titles, metadata, and images, meeting the requirement for showing all provided movie/TV details once the user is logged in.

### **George Njane**  
George developed the **Movie + TV List View** using mock data.  
This page displays summary information and images, and allows users to navigate to Evan’s detailed pages.  
This meets the requirement for viewing lists and accessing the full details for each individual item.
